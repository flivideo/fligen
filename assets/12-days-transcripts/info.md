# The 12 Days of Christmas - Song History

## Origins

"The 12 Days of Christmas" has a fascinating history that spans centuries, though its exact origins remain somewhat mysterious.

### First Appearance

The earliest known appearance of "The 12 Days of Christmas" was not as a song at all, but as a **rhyme**. The best-known English version was first printed around **1780** in a children's book called *Mirth without Mischief*, published in London. These lyrics were published without any musical notation.

### Probable Origins

While the true origins aren't definitively known, historians believe:

- The song likely originated as a **children's memory and forfeit game**
- Strong evidence suggests it has **French origins**
- The song appears to have arrived in Newcastle, England sometime in the **early 18th century**

## The Music

Over the 100+ years following its first publication, many composers wrote tunes for the words. However, **the melody we know today** is derived from a **1909 arrangement** by English composer **Frederic Austin**, who set the words to a traditional folk melody.

## Journey to America

The song's popularization in America has an interesting story:

In December 1910, **Emily Frances Brown** brought a printed copy of the carol from an Oxford shop back to Wisconsin. She first used it at a dinner at **Milwaukee-Downer College**, helping to popularize the song in the United States.

## The "Hidden Meaning" Theory

A popular theory suggests that "The 12 Days of Christmas" contained hidden Catholic teachings during times of persecution in England, with each gift supposedly representing an article of Christian faith.

**However, this theory has been debunked.** There is no supporting evidence or historical documentation to suggest the song was ever used as a coded catechism. While it makes for a fascinating story, scholars agree this interpretation is likely a modern invention.

## The Twelve Days Explained
