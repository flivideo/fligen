# 12 Days of Claude-mas

**Purpose**: Build 12 storytelling tools in 12 days using Claude Code, culminating in a visual narrative
**Dates**: December 14-25, 2024 (counting backwards to Christmas)
**Status**: Discovery phase
**Created**: 2025-12-09

## The Song: "12 Days of Christmas"

### Origin
- First appears in print in 1780 (England, children's book "Mirth Without Mischief")
- Author unknown - likely evolved from oral tradition
- Originally a memory-and-forfeit game, not a religious teaching
- Frederic Austin (1909) arranged the now-familiar melody

### The 12 Gifts
1. A partridge in a pear tree
2. Two turtle doves
3. Three French hens
4. Four calling birds
5. Five golden rings
6. Six geese a-laying
7. Seven swans a-swimming
8. Eight maids a-milking
9. Nine ladies dancing
10. Ten lords a-leaping
11. Eleven pipers piping
12. Twelve drummers drumming

### The Cumulative Structure
Each verse adds a new gift, then repeats all previous gifts in reverse. By Day 12, you're singing all 12 gifts. This recursion is the hallmark of the song.

### The "Twelve Days"
Traditionally: Christmas Day (Dec 25) to Epiphany (Jan 6)
Our version: Dec 14-25 (countdown TO Christmas, inclusive)

## The Framing

**"On the first day of Claude-mas, my Claude muse said to me..."**

Each day:
1. Play that day's updated Suno song verse
2. Recap previous days' tools (cumulative like the original)
3. Reveal and demo the new day's tool
4. Tease tomorrow

## The Metaphors

### Primary: The Gift-Giver
You're not receiving gifts - you're **crafting gifts for the world**.

Each tool is an act of generosity: capabilities that expand human imagination, given freely to creators, storytellers, and builders.

Claude is the quiet muse beside you, the collaborator - not the star.

This aligns with David's ethos of being of service.

### Secondary: The Builder's Chorus
Each tool adds a new "voice" to your creative orchestra:
- Day 1: first solitary voice
- Day 2: harmony
- Day 3: rhythm
- ...building up...
- Day 12: full choir singing as one

The song layers verses; your tools layer capabilities.

### Flavoring: The Creative Advent (selective phrases)
- "The first day is the first flame"
- "Each tool lights another window of your creative house"
- "By Day 12, the whole workshop is glowing"

Use for beauty, not as the guiding metaphor.

## The Team

| Person | Role |
|--------|------|
| David | Lead builder, presenter |
| Mary | Team member (Christian background - father is pastor) |
| Jan | Team member (Christian background - father is pastor) |
| Steve | Day 12 integration - ComfyUI workflow, professional video generation |

Note: The Gift-Giver metaphor honors the spirit of service without leaning into religious doctrine.

## The Vision: Day 12

All 12 tools come together in a **final visual narrative** - a small story that demonstrates every capability built over the 12 days.

Think: "The Boy and the Baker" but smaller.

Steve builds a ComfyUI workflow that can work for all 12 days, integrating each tool's output.

The choir sings as one. The workshop lights the final candle. The gift is given.

## The 12 Capabilities (Draft)

| Day | Tool | Voice Added |
|-----|------|-------------|
| 1 | Image Generator (FAL/KIE) | The first spark |
| 2 | Character Builder | Personality, roles, backstory |
| 3 | Lyric/Music Tool (Suno) | The musical voice |
| 4 | Voice Tool (11 Labs) | Characters can speak |
| 5 | Artifact/Object Generator | Holy Grail, Excalibur, magical items |
| 6 | Scene & Background Builder | Consistent environments |
| 7 | Theme/Style Consistency Engine | Style-locking across assets |
| 8 | Animation Frame Generator | Frame-to-frame motion |
| 9 | NPC Generator | Side characters with depth |
| 10 | Narrative Logic Tool | Acts, beats, conflicts, resolutions |
| 11 | Shot-List/Storyboard Tool | Assets + narrative → sequences |
| 12 | Final Visual Story | All gifts unite (with Steve + ComfyUI) |

**Note**: This is a draft. Some may be diffusion model generations, some Claude Code applications. Mix of:
- FAL.AI / KIE.AI (image, video)
- Suno (music)
- 11 Labs (voice)
- ComfyUI (Steve's workflows)
- Claude Code (application logic)

## The Meetup

**Claude Meetup - Chiang Mai**
- Date: December 20, 2024
- First Claude meetup in Chiang Mai
- Funded by Anthropic

Presenting the 12 Days of Claude-mas series positions well for this event.

## Additional Candidates (Backup Pool)

Beyond the 12 capabilities draft, these ideas can swap in if something fails:

| Idea | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Napkin AI clone | Infographics from text |
| Gamma AI clone | Data → presentations |
| Video project search website | Searchable index of recordings |
| Transcript explorer (no LLM) | Word clouds, filler counter, quotable moments |

**Transcript tool ideas (each could be a day):**
- Word frequency / word clouds
- Silence/pause detection (natural edit points)
- Keyword search across transcripts
- "Quotable moments" finder
- Timestamp linking
- Filler word counter
- Talk speed analysis
- Chapter auto-detection

## Selection Criteria

- [ ] Buildable in ~1 day with Claude
- [ ] Produces shareable visual output
- [ ] Can demo compellingly on video
- [ ] Fits the cumulative "choir" structure
